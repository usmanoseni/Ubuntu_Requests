# Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher Assignment
## Your Task
Create a Python script that:

Prompts the user for a URL containing an image

Creates a directory called "Fetched_Images" if it doesn't exist

Downloads the image from the provided URL

Saves it to the Fetched_Images directory with an appropriate filename

Handles errors gracefully, respecting that not all connections succeed

## Requirements
Use the requests library to fetch the image

Check for HTTP errors and handle them appropriately

Create the directory if it doesn't exist using os.makedirs() with exist_ok=True

Extract the filename from the URL or generate one if not available

Save the image in binary mode
